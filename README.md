# R code
This is the R code for the correlation and linear regression analysis in Ishiya et al. (under review)

## Perform analysis

This script will automatically install the dependent packages (ggplot2, ggrepel, tidyverse) if they are not already installed.

1. Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/omics-tools/natagenome_rscript.git`

2. Run the Rscript (corr_test.R) on the terminal.
`Rscript corr_test.R`

3. Finally, the figure (rep_summary.pdf) and the table of test results (cor_reg_results.txt) will be generated.
